I am a Computer Science Major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028, I might transfer though.

##Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7, Part 1
I enjoyed this lab since it helped reinforce my understanding of conditions. The complex parking rules we had to simulate opened my perspective on how multiple conditions can interact with each other, and also gave me insight on the proper order in which you place conditionals within a program.

Lab 10, Part 1
This lab was very fun for me to do during the lab session, since I personally helped explain how two-dimensional arrays worked to some of my peers. In addition, it felt great learning how to sort through large amounts of data with simple for-loops, which can be applied in the work-force.

Lab 11, Part 1
It was challenging figuring out how to create a working constructor, but I enjoyed the challenge. It felt good learning about a concept that Iâ€™ve been told to be a very important and fundamental concept for many fields of programming, which is object-oriented programming.
